- dns servers are unreliable here; configure modem connection to always use google dns (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)... did we do this?
- locking down internet connection and/or firewall - mess with routing tables?
- handling of non-ascii characters (delegate to receiver end)
  
- call rasdial as retryable task


x since logs are sent first, we can separately log when logs are synced and when everything is synced. this is helpful because if
  anything fails in a single send batch, all logs are resent... even those that got through before the fail
  i don't think this feature is useful anymore, because there is only a small window of failure where it helps us
  if there are few logs, there is little penalty to resending them; if there are many logs, we still have to get most of the way
  through the transmission before we wouldn't have to resend all of them. without recording the individual log entries sent, there
  isn't much we can do.
